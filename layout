========================

Typos:
 -> color correct letters in red, until corrected
 -> don't count towards correct symbols
 -> every additional wrong one also counts towards errors

Keep statistics:
 -> latency for each symbol
 -> error rate for each symbol
 -> error rate for each symbol pair

 => store list of symbols with timing

Implementation:
 -> list of letters to type
 -> list of typed letters
 -> list of errors
 -> list of timings between letters


~ Use more rows for meta combinations, e.g. ctrl + alt + $, maybe capture meta key? => hard to do in terminal...
~ There are many combinations, that will trigger escape sequences in terminal.
 -> use package pyxhook to get all kinds of keys (incl. meta etc.)
 -> open new dummy window like xev that can be activated and captures all x inputs (terminal will die on ctrl + c)
 -> can also track keyup and keydown timings


~ Show this in colors per finger, active letter in bold/underline/italic and maybe inverted color
    US Layout:
Major:
~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ +
   Q W E R T Y U I O P { } |
    A S D F G H J K L : "
     Z X C V B N M < > ?

     z x c v b n m , . /
