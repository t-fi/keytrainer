========================

Typos:
 -> color correct ones in red, until corrected
 -> don't count towards correct symbols
 -> every additional wrong one also counts towards errors

Keep statistics:
 -> latency for each symbol
 -> error rate for each symbol
 -> error rate for each symbol pair

 => store list of symbols with timing
